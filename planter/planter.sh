# Use like: ./planter/planter.sh bazel build //cmd/...
#
# - $TAG can be overridden to choose a bazel version eg `TAG=0.8.0 planter.sh ...`
# - $DOCKER_EXTRA can be set to supply extra args in the docker call
# - $DRY_RUN will trigger echoing the docker call instead of running it
# - planter will always `docker pull $IMAGE` before running it, see below
#
# To build kubernetes, first you checkout github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
# to $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/kubernetes and github.com/kubernetes/test-infra
# to $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/test-infra.
#
# Then you can build with:
# $ cd $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/kubernetes`
# $ $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/test-infra/planter/planter.sh make bazel-build`
